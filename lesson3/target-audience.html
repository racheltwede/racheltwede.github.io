      <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
        <p>The majority of people who will visit this site will be residents of the southeast corner of Idaho, specifically 
            the cities of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. They may be either male or female, but will likely be caucasian, 
            middle-class, and of middle age or older. They are also likely to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
            Latter-Day Saints, and are also more likely to belong to a family with more children than is average for 
            the United States.
        </p>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>Persona 1: Jennifer Davis</p>
        <p>The thirty-five-year-old mother of four young children. She has been married to her husband, who works as a 
            registered nurse, for fifteen years. Jennifer is currently a stay-at-home mother, but worked as a secretary for
            an elementary school for a few years early on on their marriage. Their family is fairly technologically savvy; 
            both adults own a smartphone and laptop, and their oldest son (age 14) also owns a cell phone. Jennifer was raised 
            in Phoenix, Arizona, but moved to Idaho for college, where she met her husband, and never left. For the most part, 
            Jennifer enjoys the quiet environment of Preston, but she occasionally misses the more croweded environment of the 
            city. Because of this, she enjoys attending social and cultural events in the area, and especially enjoys taking 
            the opportunity to use these events as family bonding activities.        
        </p>
        <p>Persona 2: Elias Miller</p>
        <p>A seventy-year-old retired man who was raised in Soda Springs and who currently lives in Saint George, Utah.
            He has a son and grandchildren who still live in Soda Springs. He enjoys fishing, camping, reading, and spending time 
            with his family. He is currently divorced, but still cares very much for his children and grandchildren and enjoys 
            visiting them often. He worked for many years as a truck driver. While he graduated from high school, he never 
            recieved a college degree. He owns a smartphone and a desktop computer, and while he is not as proficient with 
            technology as some of his grandchildren, he uses both devices semi-regularly and feels comfortable operating them.
