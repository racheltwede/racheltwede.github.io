            towns tucked into Idaho's beautiful southeastern corner. Here, you'll find information on the weather 
            and local events for these towns, as well articles relevant to each location. The site also

            <p>If you thought last year's summer was hot, then it looks like we have some bad news. Not only will the next months 
                likely continue our long wave of abnormally warm weather, but some experts say that we're likely to see higher 
                temperatures than have ever been recorded in our community. Our current predictions say that we might be
                seeing temperatures of up to a whopping 106&#176;F this July—a full five degrees higher than the current
                record! This heat wave isn't letting up, and it's about to get a whole lot worse before it gets better.
            </p>
            <p>As someone whose family has lived in or near Franklin County for generations, I've heard all sorts of stories about 
                unusual storms and weather events. As a kid, I would often wonder what it would be like to live through a 
                record-breaking snowfall or to see one of the rare tornadoes that occasionally passes through the area. Now 
                that it looks like I'm about to watch a new weather record be made, though, I have to admit that it's not all 
                it's cracked up to be.
            </p>
            <p>More worrisome than the discomfort of feeling a little warm is the increased risk for drought and wildfires. 
                The fact that we had a dry, mostly snow-free winter doesn't exactly help us on that front. Water levels in
                local reservoirs may not be at so-called "emergency levels" yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to see restrictions 
                on water usage being mandated sometime soon.
